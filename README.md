## Manual install

Clone this repository to your system and move into the sureflap project subfolder:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/sustineo/sureflap-api.git
```

This project utilizes **Poetry**, a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you (https://python-poetry.org/).

Install poetry via pip:

```bash
pip install --user poetry
```

Installing required dependencies and move into the virtual environment created by Pipenv:

```bash
poetry install
```

Set at least the required environment variables:

```bash
export SUREFLAP_EMAIL={YOUR_SUREFLAP_EMAIL}
export SUREFLAP_PASSWORD={YOUR_SUREFLAP_PASSWORD}
```

Start the integrated webserver with the following command:

```bash
poetry run python .\sureflap_api\main.py
```

> For all available options take a look at the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

# Configuration

The configuration is done via environment variables. The following options are available:

### `SUREFLAP_EMAIL` (required)

Email of your _Sure Petcare_ account. Make sure to use an account with control privileges if you want to use the full capabilities of this API. You can change the privileges on the official Sure Petcare website.

### `SUREFLAP_PASSWORD` (required)

Password of the in `SUREFLAP_EMAIL` specified _Sure Petcare_ account.

### `SUREFLAP_LOGLEVEL` (optional)

> Default: info

The `SUREFLAP_LOGLEVEL` option controls the level of log output and can be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are dealing with an unknown issue.

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

### `SUREFLAP_PORT` (optional)

> Default: 3001

The port for the ASGI server. This is the same as the port used for API requests. Please make sure that the specified port isn't used by another application.

### `SUREFLAP_CORS` (optional)

> Default: None

Enables CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for the specified domain names or ip adresses. Define a comma-seperated list of fully qualified domain names or ip adresses or `*` to enable CORS for all domains. The latter is not recommended from a security perspective.
